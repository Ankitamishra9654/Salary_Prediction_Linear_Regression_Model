# Salary_Prediction_Linear_Regression_Model
Salary Prediction Model
This repository contains a simple linear regression model designed to predict the salary of workers based on their years of work experience. The model utilizes the matplotlib library for visualization, as well as pandas and sklearn for model building.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project was collected from the YBI foundation/Dataset repository. It includes information on workers' salaries and their corresponding years of work experience. The model considers the salary as the dependent variable and the experience as the independent variable.

Model Details
The linear regression model is defined by the equation:

Salary = 9342 * Experience + 27010.963630394683 + e

where Experience represents the number of years of work experience and e is the error term.

Model Accuracy
The model's accuracy is determined by evaluating the error found during the prediction process. In this case, the error is calculated as 0.06230870755908321. With this error, the model demonstrates an accuracy of 94%.
